I started with a fear of flying, disliking the idea of being in a metal tube hurtling through the sky. However, this fear soon transformed into fascination, as I was driven to unravel the mysteries behind the incredible feat of human capability that allowed those airplanes to soar smoothly through the air. Armed with the boundless knowledge of the internet, I began a quest to understand the intricacies of the aviation system. I delved into the mechanics of flight, the intricacies of air traffic control, the rigorous training required for pilots, the complexities of meteorology, the physics of aircraft, and much more. I became entrenched in the aviation world, an obsession I would never escape. In the course of my research, I stumbled upon Microsoft Flight Simulator X, a simulation game that became my portal to aviation adventures. From landing at St. Maarten airport to embarking on F-18 missions, I was hooked. Soon, my virtual flights evolved into more sophisticated endeavors. I meticulously planned commercial routes, piloted realistic aircraft like the PMDG 737-800, and mastered standard instrument procedures. I found myself on Vatsim, an online network that united aviation enthusiasts in the virtual skies, where I polished my phraseology and technical skills. I would even make trips to SFO just to watch planes land, immersing myself in the world of controller communications via LiveATC.net.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/PrivatePilot/FrontView.JPEG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/PrivatePilot/FrontView.JPEG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/PrivatePilot/FrontView.JPEG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/PrivatePilot/FrontView.JPEG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>I knew that I had to take my passion to the real skies. An opportunity came in the form of an introductory flight Palo Alto and south over the Santa Cruz mountains. I performed stalls, steep turns, and some pattern work. It was a defining moment, one that convinced me to pursue a pilot’s license. I threw myself into rigorous study, immersing myself in the depths of aviation systems, flight planning, meteorology, the national airspace system, and all the knowledge required to become a private pilot. My instructor, Ben, played a pivotal role in refining my knowledge for the written test. Milestones came and went during this phase, from my first solo flight, to cross-country journeys with my instructor, to the mesmerizing sights of wind turbines during a night flight to Modesto. I completed my first solo cross-country flight to Chico airport, even making a stop at Sacramento International. Finally, the culmination of my journey arrived with the checkride exam. As I successfully passed the preflight exam and executed the required maneuvers for the practical portion, I had realized my childhood dream. I had demonstrated both the knowledge and capability to achieve my goals.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Mather.JPEG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Mather.JPEG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Mather.JPEG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Mather.JPEG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Yet, as I reflect on my aviation journey, I am keenly aware that this is merely the beginning. The vast realm of aviation knowledge remains largely uncharted for me, and there is always more to learn. I understand the dangers of complacency, especially during the hours when a pilot starts feeling overly confident, somewhere between 200 and 500 hours of flight time. Rather than seeing this as a deterrent, I view it as a source of motivation. The idea that there is infinite room for improvement in my aviation skills excites me.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Airport.JPEG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Airport.JPEG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Airport.JPEG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Airport.JPEG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>My aviation journey is a testament to the transformation of fear into a passionate love for the skies. It’s a story of perseverance, dedication, and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. As I continue to soar through the boundless realm of aviation, I am reminded that there is always something new to discover, and that the joy of learning and improving is an integral part of the pilot’s journey.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/PrivatePilot/MeFlying.JPEG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/PrivatePilot/MeFlying.JPEG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/PrivatePilot/MeFlying.JPEG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/PrivatePilot/MeFlying.JPEG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Mountains.JPEG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Mountains.JPEG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Mountains.JPEG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/PrivatePilot/Mountains.JPEG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Flying"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Druid Heights</title><link href="/blog/2022/Druid-Heights/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Druid Heights"/><published>2022-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/blog/2022/Druid-Heights</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2022/Druid-Heights/"><![CDATA[<figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Aban1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Aban1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Aban1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Aban1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of delving into the philosophical teachings of the celebrated writer and speaker, Alan Watts. You’ve probably encountered his inspiring talks online, as they’re widely available in the motivational speaker corner of YouTube. The specific channel I was engrossed in at the time was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TrueMeaning/&quot;">TrueMeaning</a>, which is devoted entirely to sharing Alan Watts’ insightful messages.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Watts-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Watts-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Watts-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Watts.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Intrigued by the man, I promptly navigated to Wikipedia to learn more about him. To my surprise, I found that Alan Watts had passed away on Mount Tamalpais, the tallest peak in Marin County, right here in the vicinity of where I live. The specific location was a place known as Druid Heights. It soon became apparent that this was no ordinary town. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid_Heights">Wikipedia</a>, Druid Heights emerged as a bohemian community with its roots in the creative spirit of the renowned poet Elsa Gidlow. It served as a gathering place for numerous influential artists and visionaries during the San Francisco counterculture era. During the 1970s, the Federal government acquired the land, either through purchase or eminent domain, and integrated it into the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. This move resulted in the abandonment and subsequent deterioration of nearly all of the buildings, with only two structures remaining.</p> <p><img src="/images/DruidHeights/Aban2.jpg" alt=""/></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Aban2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Aban2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Aban2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Aban2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>With a newfound sense of curiosity, I decided to embark on an adventure to explore this intriguing location. After a quick call to a friend, we set off. The specific address, 732 Camino del Canyon, is somewhat secluded, and you can’t drive directly to it. Instead, you need to park in a small lot situated on Muir Woods Rd, right by the entrance to Camino Del Canyon. From there, it’s roughly a 20-minute walk along the road to reach the destination. The thick tree cover in the area made it challenging to identify individual houses, so I had to rely on a map to navigate through the region.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/DruidMap-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/DruidMap-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/DruidMap-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/DruidMap.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Map-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Map-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Map-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Map.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>it’s essential to note that there are a few privately owned sections within the vicinity, which are not part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. So, if you plan to visit, exercise caution to avoid trespassing on private property.</p> <p>As we ventured closer to the area, our attention was drawn to a collapsed building perched atop a hill. It was concealed behind thick and overgrown vegetation, making it inaccessible from our current vantage point. Undeterred, we pressed on along the path until we stumbled upon an entrance leading up the hill.</p> <p>Here are the photos we captured during our exploration of the area.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/ArtInWattLib-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/ArtInWattLib-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/ArtInWattLib-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/ArtInWattLib.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/ManyTrees-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/ManyTrees-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/ManyTrees-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/ManyTrees.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Car-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Car-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Car-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Car.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/CoolWindow-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/CoolWindow-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/CoolWindow-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/CoolWindow.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/JapaneseMeditation-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/JapaneseMeditation-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/JapaneseMeditation-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/JapaneseMeditation.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Kitchen-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Kitchen-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Kitchen-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Kitchen.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/TahoeMap-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/TahoeMap-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/TahoeMap-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/TahoeMap.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Window-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Window-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/DruidHeights/Window-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/DruidHeights/Window.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Exploration"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
